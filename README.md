## Framework
 Our method includes two steps: First, we leverage the image formation model of the FPR to guide the generation of data for network training in a self-supervised manner. Second, we exploit the physical model to fine-tune the pre-trained model to impose the physics-consistency constraint on the network prediction.

## Result
 Our method provides the best image quality, more results can be found in paper and supplement.
